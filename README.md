This is my first script (Python)  
  it can a bit faster update wallpaper on your pc (tested on Windows 10)
  
How it works: 
 1. Check the last run date
 2. Query the display resolution
 3. Download today wallpapper from yandex.ru with required resolution
 4. Replaces the wallpaper  (SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER)
