A tiny program (developed with Python)
it can slightly update the wallpaper on your PC (tested on Windows 10)

Stable version with installation

How it works:
1. Checks the date of the last run
2. Requests the display resolution
3. Loads today's wallpapers from yandex.ru with the required resolution
4. Replaces wallpaper (SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER)
5. And also you can save the current wallpaper
